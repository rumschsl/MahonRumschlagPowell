Taxonomy Domain Data Set Description
-------------------------------------------------------------
List of taxa in the BioData Taxonomy Domain. Fish and Invertebrate domains 
contain all columns in the BioData system, and therefore columns are not 
necessarily applicable for all communities (fish, invertebrates, algae). 
The algae domain is a subset of relevant columns


Column Definitions
------------------

Column: BenchTaxonName
Description: The taxon name assigned by a taxonomist in the lab (at the 
"bench") or in the field. May be a conditional, provisional, or operational 
name. Serves as root name for crosswalks to other taxonomic systems

Column: BenchTaxonNameReferenceCode
Description: Code for the reference having the taxonomic description of 
BenchName. In combination with BenchName it forms a composite logical key 
that uniquely identifies a Taxon Concept

Column: TaxonConceptState
Description: Field that determines if a taxon concept (combination of 
BenchTaxonName and BenchTaxonNameReferenceCode) will be accepted in data 
upload
Domain
    * Current: considered up-to-date and will be accepted in data
    * Deprecated: accepted in data but may be rejected in the near future,
      and may be reported under a different name in data retrievals
    * Retired: retired from use and will be rejected if used for incoming
      data

Column: BiologicalCommunity
Description: Taxon membership in one of the following: Fish, Invertebrate, 
Algae

Column: AlgalGroup
Description: Taxon membership (algae only) in one of the following: 
Blue-Green Algae; Brown Algae; Cryptophytes; Diatoms; Dinoflagellates; 
Euglenoids; Green Algae; Red Algae; Unknown Phyla; Yellow-Green Algae; Red 
Algae; Yellow-Green Algae; Green Algae; Blue-Green Algae; Unknown Phyla; 
Euglenoids; Cryptophytes; Dinoflagellates

Column: BenchTaxonProvisional
Description: Indicates if taxon conforms to ICZN or ICBN standards (yes, 
no)

Column: BenchTaxonHybrid
Description: "Yes" indicates taxon is a hybrid

Column: BU_ID
Description: Identifier used in USGS National Water Quality Lab, Biological 
Unit

Column: NADED_ID

names maintained by the Academy of Natural Sciences of Drexel University; 
http://diatom.acnatsci.org/ <http://diatom.acnatsci.org/>

Column: BioDataTaxonName
Description: Taxon according to BioData current taxonomic system

Column: BioDataCommonName
Description: Common or vernacular name of taxon

Column: BioDataShortName
Description: Short, coded version of a TaxonName useful for column headers 
in a table or when graphing

Column: BioDataTaxonProvisional
Description: Indicates if taxon conforms to ICZN or ICBN standards (yes, 
no)

Column: BioDataTaxonHybrid
Description: "Yes" indicates taxon is a hybrid

Column: PublishedTaxonName
Description: The "nearest" TaxonName that has been published following 
International Commission of Zoological Nomenclature (ICZN) for inverts and 
fish or International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN) for algae, 
convention; authority is not included. Provisional names cannot be used in 
this field

Column: PublishedTaxonNameAuthority
Description: Taxonomic authority for HierarchyTaxonName

Column: ITIS_TSN

http://www.itis.gov <http://www.itis.gov/> > represented by the ITIS_TSN

Column: PublishedSortOrder
Description: Numeric code used to sort data according to taxonomic order

Column: PublishedTaxonLevel
